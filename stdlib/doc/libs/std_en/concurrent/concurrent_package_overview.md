# std.concurrent

## Feature Overview

The `concurrent` package provides functions and types for structured concurrency.

[threadScope\<T, R>](./concurrent_package_api/concurrent_package_funcs.md#func-threadscopet-rthreadgroupt---r) creates a scope for groups of Cangjie threads. The scope receives a [ThreadGroup\<T>](./concurrent_package_api/concurrent_package_classes.md#class-threadgroupt) instance, launches threads through the group, and does not return until all threads launched in the group have completed, successfully or otherwise.

`ThreadGroup<T>` stores the eventual result of each launched thread. The group implements [Iterable\<T>](../core/core_package_api/core_package_interfaces.md#interface-iterablee), and thread results are consumed by iteration. Results are yielded as threads complete i.e. the iteration order is the same as the order that the threads complete.

If the scope itself throws an [Exception](../core/core_package_api/core_package_exceptions.md#class-exception) or [Error](../core/core_package_api/core_package_exceptions.md#class-error), or if an unhandled thread `Exception` or `Error` is thrown while consuming task results, `threadScope` sends cancellation requests to the remaining threads launched in the group, waits for outstanding thread results to be drained, and then rethrows the failure.
As with `Future<T>`, cancellation is cooperative. A thread that wishes to respond to cancellation requests must check [Thread.currentThread.hasPendingCancellation](../core/core_package_api/core_package_classes.md#prop-haspendingcancellation). 

This package provides the following structured concurrency API:

- [ThreadGroup\<T>](./concurrent_package_api/concurrent_package_classes.md#class-threadgroupt): A group used to launch, cancel, and collect results from grouped concurrent threads.

- [threadScope\<T, R>((ThreadGroup\<T>) -> R)](./concurrent_package_api/concurrent_package_funcs.md#func-threadscopet-rthreadgroupt---r): Runs concurrent threads in a scope and waits for all launched threads to complete before returning.
